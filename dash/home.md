We explore new ways to share knowledge in Natural Products research.

This is LOTUS, it is an online resource for NP occurrences.

The LOTUS data is available under [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
It is hosted in parallel at https://www.wikidata.org/ and
https://search.nprod.net/.

The Wikidata version allows for community curation and addition
of novel data and this search engine is updated daily with new
data. 

We strongly encourage you to get fresh data from Wikidata instead and later archive the results of your query.
If you want something citable with a DOI, frozen versions of LOTUS are available at https://zenodo.org/communities/the-lotus-initiative. (https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.5794106, mainly).
