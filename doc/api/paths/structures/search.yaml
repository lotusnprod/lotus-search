    Search structures by structure matching
  description: |
    Search structures by structure matching given a SMILES. Additional parameters allow to specify the kind of search (sub structure/exact) and the parameters)

            molecule:
              type: string
              example: C1=CC=CC=C1
              description: |
                A MOL file or SMILES of the structure of the structure or part of it.

                Search by substructure
            similarity_level:
              type: number
              example: 0.8
              description: |
                Similarity level cut-off (basic tanimoto-like search). Does nothing is substructure_search is true.
