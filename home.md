We explore new ways to share knowledge in Natural Products research. 
    
This is LOTUS, it aims at sharing an online resource for NP 
occurrences. The LOTUS data is available under [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). 
It is hosted in parallel at https://www.wikidata.org/ and 
https://search.nprod.net/.

The Wikidata version allows for community curation and addition
 of novel data and this search engine is updated daily with new
 data.
