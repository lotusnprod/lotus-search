# README

## Description

This application is available on [Nprod.net](https://search.nprod.net)

The dataset is from the [LOTUS](https://lotus.nprod.net) initiative and [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org).

## Requirements

- [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com) for its web ui.
- [EPAM's Ketcher](https://lifescience.opensource.epam.com/ketcher/index.html?ref=search.nprod.net) for the molecule
  editor.
- [Rdkit](https://www.rdkit.org) for the molecule massaging.

## Install & use

### The docker compose way (recommended)

```shell
docker-compose run -it backend python update.py  # You do not have to run it everytime, but that's recommended until we have a schema versioning
docker-compose up --build
```

The web server is then available on <http://localhost:3000> and the API on <http://localhost:5000>.

### Run tests

```
make tests
```

### The manual way

To run it yourself, the source is available at: <https://github.com/lotusnprod/lotus-search>:

- Install dependencies using uv
    - If you do not have uv installed:
        - `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
    - Then:
        - `uv sync`
- Run `python update.py` (takes a few minutes)
- Run `uvicorn main:app --reload` (almost instant)

## Performance & Benchmarks

Lightweight, opt-in micro benchmarks are available to help detect regressions in
common hot paths (taxonomy lookups, structure searches, SDF extraction).

Run after preparing data (i.e. after `python update.py` has generated the `data/` directory):

```bash
make bench
```

Environment variables:

- `BENCH_ITER` (default 200) controls repetition count for cached taxonomy lookups.

Sample output (JSON lines):

```json
{"benchmark": "taxa_name_matching_first", "seconds": 0.0123, "size": 42}
{"benchmark": "taxa_name_matching_cached", "seconds": 0.00001, "size": 42}
{"benchmark": "structure_similarity", "seconds": 0.0042, "size": 1200}
```

Caching / Optimization notes:

- Several pure taxonomy helper methods now use `functools.lru_cache` to reduce repeat
  DB round-trips during interactive browsing. These caches are per-process and safe
  because the underlying dataset is immutable at runtime.
- SDF block retrieval is streamlined to a single join over memory-mapped slicesâ€”same
  ordering/content, fewer Python allocations.
- A single `DataModel` instance is re-used across Dash pages (legacy import path via
  `model.model` retained for compatibility) to avoid redundant large in-memory loads.

All changes preserve existing API outputs and test expectations (see test suite).

## Data safety

Your molecules are never stored unless they make our service crash.

But if your molecules are super secret, it is like your extremities, don't insert
them in machines you don't know or understand.

Also, this is an experimental tool meant to test things,
you're not supposed to rely on it for anything important, and
it comes with no warranty or support whatsoever.
